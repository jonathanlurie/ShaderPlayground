## shader_cube_moving_texture.html
Displays jpeg strip as a "cinematic" since the strip is composed of 64 images of the brain at different depth.

## shader_world_coordinates.html
Use the vertex shader to find the 3D world coordinates and make them accessible from the fragment shader. Then change the color of a moving cube depending on it 3D position on world space.

## draggablecubes_shader_world_coord.html
Just like `shader_world_coordinates.html` to adapt the color on the world coordinate positioning. This example is based on the [draggable cubes](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_interactive_draggablecubes.html) of ThreeJS, so that playing with colors is easier.
